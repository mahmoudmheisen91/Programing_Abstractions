* File: checkout.cpp
* ------------------
* This program simulates a checkout line, such as one you
* might encounter in a grocery store. Customers arrive at
* the checkout stand and get in line. Those customers wait
* in the line until the cashier is free, at which point
* they are served and occupy the cashier for a randomly
* chosed period of time. After the service time is complete,
* the cashier is free to serve the next customer in the line.
*
* The waiting line is represented by a Queue<int> in which the
* integer value stored in the queue is the time unit in which
* that customer arrived. Storing this time makes it possible
* to determine the average waiting time for each customer.
*
* In each unit of time, up to the parameter SIMULATION_TIME,
* the following operations are performed:
*
* 1. Determine whether a new customer has arrived.
*
 New customers arrive randomly, with a probability
*
 determined by the parameter ARRIVAL_PROBABILITY.
*
* 2. If the cashier is busy, note that the cashier has
*
 spent another minute with that customer. Eventually,
*
 the customer's time request is satisfied, which frees
*
 the cashier.
*
* 3. If the cashier is free, serve the next customer in line.
*
 The service time is taken to be a random period between
*
 MIN_SERVICE_TIME and MAX_SERVICE_TIME.
*
* At the end of the simulation, the program displays the
* parameters and the following computed results:
*
* o The number of customers served
* o The average time spent in line
* o The average number of customers in the line

* the program first checks to see whether a new customer arrives.
* Then, if the cashier is busy (indicated by a nonzero value for
* serviceTimeRemaining), the program decrements that variable to
* indicate that one more time unit has passed. Finally, if the
* cashier is free, the simulation serves another customer from
* the queue after recording the waiting time for that customer.
